# Development challenge

At Perceptual Robotics we usually work on features vertically through the stack, from the backend methods to the frontend UIs.

For out internal development team we usually expect everyone to be comfortable with both sides. Comfortable meaning that you can complete tasks, without being an expert in both. 

Challenge:
- Use this repo as a guide for the challenge
- Build a CRUD API on AWS to supply data for your app
- Build a UI consumer to render data from your CRUD API
- Implement a UI-based search function
- Deploy both sides of the system
- Share the repo, and the two deployed asset links

We will use your development challenge as a source of discussion in the next stage of the interview.

Good luck! 

## Brief

More details on the brief can be found in the [BRIEF document](./BRIEF.md)

## Submission

Once you've complete the challenge:
- Send us an email with the challenge details
- Include the UI repo, the BE repo, the UI deployed link, the BE deployed link

Your submission should look like this: 

```
Hi there,

Here is my ui repo: ui_repo.url

Here is my be repo: be_repo.url


Here is my deployed UI: ui.url

Here is my backeck API: api.url

...

```

## Guidelines

Do's:
- Commit early and often 
- Pay attention to the brief and the designs
- Spend time to really develop parts you enjoy the most
- Use your creativity to reduce the amount of work require
- Stick to patterns for both backend and frontend
- Use modules to speed up complex tasks
- Think about the challenge as if it is a production-ready app, not a tutorial app
- Ask questions if you're unsure about a feature

Don't:
- Include the whole solution in one commit
- Spend too much time on UI deployment - 
- Get stuck on one task - move quickly through tasks, and come back to add more complexity
- Spend longer than 3-5h - welcome to spend more time if you're enjoying it, but try to cap it
